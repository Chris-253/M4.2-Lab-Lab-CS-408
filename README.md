# birdwatching-site

This is a simple web project built in plain HTML and CSS. The goal was to take
starter assets (HTML, images, blank stylesheet) and turn them into a functional
homepage for a birdwatching website. The focus was on **structural markup** and
a clean layout, not on adding frameworks or JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the project files and open the HTML in your browser.  
There are no extra dependencies, installs, or build steps. Just:

```bash
open index.html
